This is a simple proof of concept for a model object that automatically pulls data from a server. The idea is that on load, only a subset of the data would be requested, then as the user loads screens where data is needed that wasn't loaded in the initial subset, it'd be automatically requested. The hope is that this, along with the smart use of client side caching and websockets could be used to create an efficient model layer that developers of varying skill levels could use to build new features quickly but still maintain consistency with other parts of a project.
